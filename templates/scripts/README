This template is an example of a template that imports all monitoring not
related to a single machine. It has the aggregations, the cloudwatch items,
the deregistration automation and the and all the macros required byy them

Note: It also contains the LinuxBasic template, if you already added it to
your host it can cause a conflict. You have a good option:

 - Unlink the Template_LinuxBasic from your host without clear it
 - Once you import the Template_Scripts, all your previous LinuxBasic items
   will be back to Template_LinuxBasic


Requirements:

 - Import all the other templates before start

Notes:

 - If you want to see everything working, you will need a Varnish pool group,
   a AWS read-only account to get cloudwatch values, a running RDS instances,
   and an Autoscaling group. But none are required.


How to:

 - Import all other templates into Zabbix server
 - Import this template into Zabbix server
 - Chose a host to link the template, usually it is the Zabbix Server or a
   host dedicated to run scripts
 - Install the following chef recipes in that host's role or recipe:
   *check their templates instructions for manually and automated instalations

   zabbix::agent-deregister
   zabbix::agent-cloudwatch

 - Configure the macros
