Cloudwatch monitoring for Zabbix 1.8.5

Goals: persist cloudwatch metrics

Examples of:
     - Item, trigers, graphs for EC2, RDS and Autoscalling

Requirenments: 

 - Python boto at the server that will run the collector script
   $ sudo apt-get install python-boto (or use chef's recipe below)

Warning: even though it is cheap, you pay per thousands requests
	 to get Cloudwatch information using the API

         items are storing 3 months non-aggregated information
         after that time you still can see aggregated
         avg,min,max values

         trends are stored for 5 years, you may have a good DB for that

How to:

- Understand how Cloudwatch works and what information you can get from it
  to add more items
- Create an IAM account with read-only access to Cloudwatch
- Import the template into zabbix server
- Chose a host (can be the zabbix server) to run the scripts 
- Configure the macros variables in the host configuration, like this:
  {$MYACCOUNT} = myawsaccount
  {$AUTOSCALINGGROUPNAME} = my_autoscaling_groupname
  {$RDSINSTANCE} = my_DBInstanceIdentifier

  you can ignore the macros you not use,
  disable the related triggers though

- Link the template in the host configuration
 
- Install the scripts using chef
  - Use the chef's zabbix-aws::agent-scripts recipe at the hosts' role
    * Your zabbix-agent have to include the dir /etc/zabbix/agentd.d/
  - Use the manual instalation below to understand how does it work

- Include your account (so far 1 to 5) in the role chef/roles/myrole.rb

- Install the scripts manually
  In the server that will run the script
    - copy the file template/default/cloudwatch/zabbix-cloudwatch.py.erb
      in the chef zabbix-aws cookbook's dir (chef/cookbook/zabbix-aws)
      to /usr/local/bin/zabbix-cloudwatch.py and edit it with your accounts
    - create the directory /etc/zabbix/agentd.d/
    - copy file files/default/cloudwatch/cloudwatch.conf
      in the same chef coockbook to /etc/zabbix/agentd.d/cloudwatch.conf
    - in the server that will run the collector script:
         $ sudo mkdir /etc/zabbix/agentd.d
         $ echo 'Include=/etc/zabbix/agentd.d/' |
           sudo tee -a /etc/zabbix/agentd.conf
         $ sudo /etc/init.d/zabbix-agent restart
         $ sudo chown -R zabbix /etc/zabbix/agentd.d
         $ sudo chown -R zabbix /usr/local/bin/zabbix-aws*
         $ sudo chmod 600 /etc/zabbix/agentd.d/*
         $ sudo chmod 700 /usr/local/bin/zabbix-aws*

Note: there is an item called: Autoscaling.deregister, to be used with the
      auto-register script, ignore it until you autoregister machines,
      check the chef's zabbix-autoregister recipe for details
