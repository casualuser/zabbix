Zabbix - improvements

Those are some automations I've made initially for AWS 
The concepts are not exclusive for AWS, like abstractions, auto and de-register,
vms' steal cpu time, aggregations by groups, etc...

Please use Zabbix > 1.8.5, for ubuntu you can get it from here
http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/zabbix-agent
Minor version has api problems

If you like opscode's chef, start with this:
http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/zabbix

Dirs:

 templates/  <- zabbix templates and instalations instructions
 chef/       <- chef cookbooks, roles 
                and auto-register/de-register instructions
 scripts/    <- instruction to go to chef dir ang get them :P
