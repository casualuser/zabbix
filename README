Zabbix - AWS

Those are some automations I've made for AWS

If you like opscode's chef, start with this:
http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/zabbix

you will have to include the line below in the agent configuration:
Include=/etc/zabbix/agentd.d/


Dirs:

 templates/  <- zabbix templates and instalations instructions
 chef/       <- chef cookbooks, roles 
                and auto-register/de-register instructions
 scripts/    <- instruction to go to chef dir :P
