***** You can find information about the recipes from the templates
***** The only recipe the docummentation is right here is the Auto-register

Scripts below are based on Amazon AWS, but you can easly change it to other
kinds of infrastructures, check the "Requirements" for more information

Auto-register:

It's a recipe you attach at your role that try ONLY ONCE to register the node 
into the Zabbix Server

Notes:

   - This version is very simple, is uses Zabbix's API and shell script. You
     may need the shell tools involved pre-installed at the bootstrap for it
     works
   - There are two scripts, one using wget and another using curl. Ubuntu
     doesn't install curl by default but you still can install it by chef or
     have it pre-installed in your AMI (Amazon image)
   - It is based on Amazon EC2 and it tries to retrieve instance information
     from Amazon to store on DNS and ISID variables, you may want to change
     it to `hostname` instead if you are not using Amazon.
   - The name of the host is the Amazon EC2 Instance-id. This name will be
     used by the de-register script and by Chef to control Amazon instances.
     Zabbix 1.8.7 added more flexibility by creating a new field for machines'
     names
   - Scripts have timeout both for curl and wget, you may want to change it
     depending on your envinronment and how far or how stressed is you Zabbix
     Server
   - In case of error, the script do not blocks Chef's execution. But you may
     want to change the exit code from 0 to 1 if you want it blocked. If you
     have 24x7 support team, I recommend you change it to 1.
   - Using chef, if you want to force a SINGLE machine to be registered/enabled
     again, change it's node tag back to zabbix-MYGROUP without the postfix
   - Using chef, if you want to force ALL machines to be registered/enabled
     again, change the recipe's variable "expected_tag" to a new value and all
     machines will try again in the next chef-client run


Requirenments:

   - An Zabbix user with API access and RW rights on all templates and groups
     you will interact with. Rembember the script auto-includes the Discovered
     Hosts' group and the Template_LinuxBasic. Make sure your Template doesn't
     link the Template_LinuxBasic on it, otherwise it will conflict
   - So far and since it is a single script, it is not templatized on chef, you
     have to edit it directly to change Zabbix's user and password

Howto:

   - Put a tag called "zabbix-MYGROUP" at your role or recipe to tag all the
     machines in your group
   - Include the recipe zabbix-aws::auto-register at the end of your role or
     recipe to trigger the auto-registration process
   
Workflow:
   - Chef searches for the node's zabbix tag
   - if registered, do nothing
   - if not registered (tag doesn't contain REGISTERED)
       - Search for the group in the tag's name after zabbix-
       - Search for a Template with the same group name
       - Register the machine into Zabbix using all below:
           - this group
           - this template
           - the LinuxBasic template
           - the Discovered Hosts group
       - It also tries to enable the machine in case it was only disabled by
         the de-register script
       - Tag the host as REGISTERED
